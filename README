This shopping Android application allows users to purchase albums and determine the final price total at checkout.
Note: Please run this application using the Nexus 5X API 28 x86 (G Play Services) emulator. Thank you.

Due to enough time on my hands and my determination to balance my workload efficiently, I successfully was able to complete the project
in its entirety a few days before September 17, 2019. The documentation is detailed, the design layout for each activity is fantastic
and the code from all activities work as expected. In general, my shopping application looks very presentable to the eye and users 
deserve to use it and explore my music collection from my shop. Since I used ten elements as CardViews, I feel quite proud that I was able
to add more items, than the bare minimum of three items. I am very happy that I was able to complete all of this assignment 
on my own. Generally speaking, I hope the next assignment will be more interesting to create.

However, this project provided more code than expected (especially in the MenuActivity class) since I used methods for every button in
each CardView. The advanced methods, getParent() and getChildAt(int index), should have been used in order to simplify my code and avoid
some repetiton. If there was enough time, I certainly would of add the landscape layouts to the application to make it even more
professional. To display each object at the checkout, I should have created a new Java called ShoppingCart, in order for the entire 
elements to be transferred at the checkout with all their specific attributes. More details about each product should have been mentioned
and the design for every CardView element should be a little larger to make more accessible for othe users.

Overall, I am stil very pleased with my final output for this assignment and I wish all the best when it comes to evaluation.
